# EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2022_II_Exam_Group_XX

## General Infos

1. Due date is 2022-08-18.
1. You can withdraw from the exam up to one week before the exam.
1. You can work in groups of two students or alone.
1. Assign yourself to a [**Phy2 SS2022 Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=368635), even if you are working alone.
1. If you are working in a group of two, you may not divide tasks between you! **All group members must be involved in all tasks and in all videos!** 
1. **Download** (not clone) this git repo, **really unzip** it (right click, extract, ...) and **rename the unpacked folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.03_Phy2_SS2022_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.03_Phy2_SS2022_Exam_Group_Z`, if your Moodle group is `Z`. 
1. Edit the provided Jupyter notebooks containing the exercises and answer the questions directly in them. Add additional code and markdown cells as needed. It is not necessary to create new notebooks!
1. **Do not use pocket calculators or spreadsheet programs!** Do all your calculations explicitly in the Jupyter notebooks! Otherwise we will deduct points for this. 
1. Just providing code is not enough! **Describe shortly** what you are doing! Use **markdown cells** with **appropriate formatting** (headers, lists, typesetting of equations, etc.) in your Jupyter Notebooks to explain your steps. Use short comments in your code cells, too.
1. Present your work in the form of **videos**. Imagine you would explain it to other course members. The videos are Task 03. 
1. After you have completed the tasks, zip the directory with your code and data and **upload the zip file to Moodle.**
1. **Just one group member should upload** the report to save space on Moodle. The upload area will be published in the [**Phy2 SS2022 Moodle**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/course/view.php?id=15227) course.
