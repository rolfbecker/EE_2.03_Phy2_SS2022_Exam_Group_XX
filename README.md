# EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2022_II_Exam_Group_XX

## General Infos

1. Due date is 2022-08-18.
1. You can withdraw from the exam up to one week before the exam.
1. You can work in groups of two students or alone.
1. Assign yourself to a [**Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=368635), even if you are working alone.
1. If you are working in a group of two, you may not divide tasks between you! **All group members must be involved in all tasks and in all videos!** 
1. **Download** (not clone) this git repo, **really unzip** it (right click, extract, ...) and **rename the unpacked folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.06_SciProg_SS2022_Exam_Group_Z`, if your Moodle group is `Z`. 
1. Edit the provided Jupyter notebooks containing the exercises and answer the questions directly in them. Add additional code and markdown cells as needed. It is not necessary to create new notebooks!
1. Just providing code is not enough! **Describe shortly** what you are doing! Use **markdown cells** with **appropriate formatting** (headers, lists, typesetting of equations, etc.) in your Jupyter Notebooks to explain your steps. Use short comments in your code cells, too.
1. Do not use pocket calculators or spreadsheet programs! Do all your calculations explicitly in the Jupyter notebooks!
1. Present your work in the form of **videos**. Imagine you would explain it to other course members. 
1. After you have completed the tasks, zip the directory with your code and data and upload the zip file to Moodle. **Just one group member should upload** the report to save space on Moodle. The upload link will be announced later.  

## General Infos, Exam Only Repository

1. Due date is 2022-03-31.
1. You can deregister from the exam until 2022-02-28.
1. You can work in groups of two students or alone.
1. Assign yourself to a [**Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=362611), even if you are working alone.
1. Download (not clone) this repo and **rename the folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2021_II_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2021_II_Exam_Group_Z`, if your Moodle group is `Z`.   
1. Create **your own HSRW gitlab repository** from the downloaded and renamed directory tree, i.e. create a HSRW gitlab repository named `EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2021_II_Exam_Group_Z` from your local folder if your Moodle group is `Z`.
1. Make the gitlab repo **PRIVATE** to avoid copy and paste from others. It is enough if **one member of the group provides the group repo**. The owner of the repo can invite the other group members to collaborate and to grant push rights to them. 
1. **Grant read access to the supervisors (professors, assistants, etc.) on your repository!** Otherwise we cannot download your repo and **we cannot grade it!**
1. **Strictly follow the naming conventions for your HSRW gitlab group repo!** At due date the supervisors will search for the repo names and download them. If you choose another name or if you do not invite us for reading we will not be able to find the repo: it is as if you had not submitted your assignment and **we cannot grade it!**
1. **You have to use Jupyter notebooks for all your calculations!** We must be able to redo your calculations from the Jupyter notebook! 
1. **Describe in the Jupyter notebook what you are doing!** Just providing code is not enough! **Use markdown cells and appropriate formatting** to add your descriptive text.
