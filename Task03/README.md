# Task 03: Produce short videos explaining your work.

Produce short videos in which you explain your work by explaining your Jupyter notebooks. Save the videos in the local sub-folder [video](./video/). THey will be part of your zip file you upload to Moodle.

**Do NOT take a footage from your compuetr monitor with your smart phone!** Use porper screencast software such as OBS or similar. 

In case the videos become too large Moodle would refuse the file to be uploaded. Then we have to find another way, e.g. providing a sciebo upload area.
