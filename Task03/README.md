# Task 03: Produce short videos explaining your work.

Produce short videos in which you explain your work by explaining your Jupyter notebooks. Save the videos in the local sub-folder [videos](./videos/). THey will be part of your zip file you upload to Moodle.

**Do NOT take video recordings from your computer screen with your smartphone!** Use professional screencast software such as OBS or similar.

In case the videos become too large Moodle would refuse the file to be uploaded. Then we have to find another way, e.g. providing a sciebo upload area.
